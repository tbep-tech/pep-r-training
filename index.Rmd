# PEP R Training

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. R has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This training workshop will provide attendees with the foundation for using R work with PEP reporting products. 

## Course objectives

This course is designed to expose you to the fundamentals of using R for working with the [pepreporting](https://tbep-tech.github.io/pepreporting/index.html) R package.  We will also cover the basics of using R to work with enviornmental data. You will not be R experts by the end of the course, but you will have a solid foundation for continued learning.  By the end of this course you will be able to or have the resources to find out how to:

* Understand R fundamentals
* Use the pepreporting package to read, analyze, and plot water quality data
* Use the pepreporting package to read, analyze, and plot pathogens data
* Use the pepreporting package to read, analyze, and plot dissolved oxygen data

## Agenda

* __9:00 - 10:00__ R Basics

  BREAK (10 min)
